        <p>
          Many air–sea processes and quantities are written in terms of a
          <em>relative wind</em>—the difference between the wind velocity and some representation of the surface
          current. In our framework the relevant surface current is the
          <strong>Lagrangian</strong> mean flow \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}^L\); Stokes drift
          would importantly modify the effective relative wind. In particular, the following merit further investigation (some of which is already being undertaken):
        </p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Wind–stress parameterizations.</strong>
            Bulk formulas often take the stress to depend on the difference between
            \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}_E\), the Eulerian mean velocity, in the air and the ocean. If the
            atmosphere  instead “feels” \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}^L\), then the
            wave-induced component \(u_S\) changes the relative wind and, with it,
            the surface momentum flux.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Processes based on relative wind, such as eddy killing.</strong>
            Mechanisms where the wind extracts energy from mesoscale eddies or
            other currents depend on both the sign and magnitude of the relative
            wind. A wave-induced contribution to \(\overline{\mathbf{u}}^L\) alters that
            relative wind and can therefore modify the strength and pattern of
            these feedbacks.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>Spatial variability in observations.</strong>
            Observed spatial variability in the wave field implies a spatially
            varying Stokes drift and thus a spatially varying Lagrangian mean and
            relative wind. Doppler-based surface–current measurements already
            capture this variability, providing a pathway to incorporate the
            wave-induced feedback into wind–stress parameterizations.
          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          In this sense, the same Lagrangian drift that significantly modifies Miles’ instability
          could also significantly modify any process that depends on relative wind, from idealized growth
          rates to the large-scale air–sea energy exchanges associated with eddies
          and other currents.
