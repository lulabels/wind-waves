          the leading-order modification dependent on the wave-induced mean flow \(U^{(2)}(b)\) (the dispersion relation ends up being linear in $c^{(2)}$; no approximation is needed here).

                Modified growth rate \(k c_i\) vs wavenumber \(k\) for four wave slopes

                no surface tension. The solid curves ($\epsilon=0$) show the Miles growth rate, while the other curves include the \(\epsilon^2\) correction.

                As \(\epsilon\) increases, the \(\epsilon^2\,\mathrm{Im}\,c^{(2)}(k)\) term

              <li>
                Larger \(U_\infty^{(0)}\) corresponds to enhanced background shear, and when it and the wave
                slope are sufficiently large, there is also significant suppression at intermediate wavenumbers.
              </li>
              <li>
                This is on a log scale; the growth reduction is quite substantial, up to nearly a 40% decrease in integrated growth.
